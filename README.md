# Education Performance & Operational Efficiency Report
Using SQL, Power BI, and DAX to uncover insights in the education sector

### Project Overview
This data analytics project explores academic performance and operational efficiency in the education sector using Power BI and SQL.

More than just building dashboards, this project aimed to ask deeper questions and provide data-driven answers:

* How are students really performing?

* What trends exist across classes, teachers, subjects, even gender?

* How can we use this data to make better decisions in education?

As someone passionate about education, I have always envisioned being at the forefront of meaningful change. I believe the system can be more forward-thinking, and data-driven.

### Project Highlights
* Analyzed student performance month by month

* Identified top and struggling students, class-level strengths, and learning gaps

* Compared teacher effectiveness and performance, subject-wise

* Uncovered gender-based performance disparities

* Designed clean, interactive dashboards and KPIs for school decision-makers

### Tools & Skills Used
* Power BI

* DAX (my first hands-on experience!)

* SQL

* Data Modeling

* Data Cleaning

* Storytelling with Data

DAX was a new experience for me, and honestly, I was a bit intimidated at first. But as I dived in, I found it surprisingly fun. This project was just the beginning, but it is a leap am glad I took.

### Key Findings
* Total Assessments: 112

* Students: 94 | Teachers: 20 | Subjects: 8

* Overall Average Score: 51.50

* Top Scores: 96, 87, 86, 85
* Lowest Scores: 49.31, 44.83, 44.19
* Most Struggled Subjects: Physics, Biology, Mathematics

* Clear divide between high and low-performing classes

* Some teachers consistently outperformed others

* A gender gap was observed: males scored slightly higher overall, a disparity worth deeper investigation

### The Result
The final output is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that helps educators and decision-makers:

* Identify what's working

* Detect areas needing support

* Allocate resources more effectively
